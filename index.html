<a name="general-idea" class="anchor" href="#general-idea"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General idea</h3>

<p>This is a project to produce LaTeXed notes from the mini-courses from the <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/%7Erenzo/gw2014/">Summer School on Gromov-Witten theory</a>.  Right now, they are very rough notes, texed live during the talk.  They are shared on GitHub in part because it's a relatively easy place to host them, but also because it makes it possible for other people from the conference (or even elsewhere) to help clean them up and flesh them out.  </p>

<a name="an-ambitious-example" class="anchor" href="#an-ambitious-example"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An ambitious example</h3>

<p>As an example of how this can work; the 600 page book <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">Homotopy Type Theory</a>  was written in six months by a large group of mathematicians using GitHub.  Their GitHub repository is <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book">here</a>, and you can read something about the process by which it was written <a href="http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Potentially, we could produce very nice notes ourselves, or even a book.  This is more ambitious than I currently have in mind -- which was more along the lines of "can I TeX notes from a talk live, and can I use GitHub", but we'll see what happens; if people are excited about this, we can see what happens, and the work doesn't have to stop when the conference stops.</p>

<a name="how-to-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-to-contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to contribute</h3>

<p>Git has a reputation of being a bit complicated, but there are a large number of tutorials and help things on the web; I'm teaching myself as we go along.  I don't know that there's one introduction that's better than any others; Github has several of their own and links to others, I found <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1">This one</a> a useful place to start.</p>
