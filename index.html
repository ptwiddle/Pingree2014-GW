<p>This webpage is some version of notes from the 6 lecture series.  Right now, they are very rough notes, texed live during the talk.  Part of the point of sharing them on GitHub is that potentially other people at the conference can help clean them up and flesh them out.  Depending on how ambitious we get, we could make some very nice notes or even a book: for instance, the <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">Homotopy Type Theory</a><br>
was written by a large group of mathematicians using GitHub; their GitHub repository is <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book">here</a>, and you can read something about the process by which it was written <a href="http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The HoTT book is much more ambitious than I have in mind now, which was more along the lines of "can I TeX notes from a talk live, and can I use GitHub", but we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Git has a reputation of being a bit complicated, but there are a large number of tutorials and help things on the web; I'm teaching myself as we go along.</p>
